# TrashySnake
Repository for the game I made when applying to the Paisii Hilendarski university

This is the regular snake game, but with a twist.
The gameplay is still as a regular snake game, but the main point of the game is to collect different types of trash.
Using different buttons, the snake changes its color to one of the three.

Collecting trash not matching the color of the bin does not provide points and length to the player(snake).
